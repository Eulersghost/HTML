      <b>Summary: </b>
          I am a wizzard tasked with the highest order of the Valla.  The current position I hold is that of the "White".  As a wizzard in middle earth my general duties included serving as a confidant and an advisor for many types of men, elves, and creatures.  
          
          My intent is to apply for a position at the prestigeous school of hogwarts.  The enchanting department has my interest and is something I feel would be a good start for me.  You have my deepest thanks faculty members for considering my resume.  And for anyone interested in hiring me for an odd potion or enchantment please feel free to send a rune my way.
