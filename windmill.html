        This is an example of a thought experiment that I had regarding computer security and exploring its vulnerabilities this was inspired from the classic story of Don Quixote de La Mancha and the lessons that it teaches.  Quixote is the more idealistic user who sees the whole, whereas Sancho may be the more grounded person in reality.

        Imagine if you will a windmill that is functioning and working all of its pieces put together just right, so it accomplishes its purpose and function.  Now imagine that this windmill is made out of differing 3 dimensional blocks in the shape of puzzle pieces kind of like Tetris in a way.  These components in the windmill each contribute to the overall success of the windmill.  However, suppose in each of these individual blocks there is a rogue element.  This element could be a randomized hold, crack on the outside, inside, or it may be something on the exterior surface such as a handle.  The point of this rogue element is that there is some inherent flaw that is there that might not be a major issue in that component.

        This inherent flaw may not be apparent to anyone but the piece of block comprises a part of the whole and that whole is working just fine.  Quixote and Sancho represent the users of the windmill, and the windmill represents a computer.  A computer is a perfect and logical machine just like with any type of appliance it runs only as good as it's programming and hardware will allow it to.  But the point of this paradigm is to realize that the most dangerous part of computers and computer use are humans and our inherent imperfect nature.  It doesn't just apply to a flaw in design but it more specifically applied to an unknown element that we didn't know about, whereas if we had a two users come along and try and use the windmill.  One would be oblivious to the flaw and may or may not ignorantly use it with little or no thought or one who is grounded and curious like Sancho would know exactly how to see those flaws and correct it or exploit it.  While this outlook may be a little bleak, it is one paradigm I had to explain the greater forces at work that are threats to each other, humans using computers are greatest threats to themselves and with the information that is generated, studied, and used.  And the amount of trust and confidence put in them computers are a tool we need to learn how to better use responsibly especially with the amount of control we have surrendered to them.  With AI coming into more advances, will that inherent human flaw be translated over to computers now that are being given the means and abilities to think for themselves.

        It may be better to give ethics a chance to catch up in addition to advancement and the pursuit of discovery.  Quixote's Windmill is meant to show that humans whether they are aware of it or not impart an element of imperfection that when used with a powerful tool like computers can cause extremely great good but also catastrophic negative consequences.
