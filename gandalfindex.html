        Good day, do you mean to wish me a good day?  Or is it simply a good day whether I want it to be or not?  No matter I wanted to apply to your illustrios college as it is a leader in teaching gifted and esteemed individuals talented in the arcane arts.

        My name is Gandalf the Gray an esteemed wizzard and guardian of all types of men, elves, dwarves, hobbits, and various creatures from Middle Earth.  My current residence is in the Grayhavens living with elves and a few other of my closest friends.  However, the Valla has instructed me of the dire situation going on here on earth and it seems like you could use my help.  I will enlighten you of my qualifications and I hope you will know what to do with the time that is given to you.
